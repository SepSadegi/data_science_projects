## Simple Linear Regression Projects

### 1. EcoEngine: CO2 Emission Predictor

This project demonstrates how to implement simple linear regression using scikit-learn to predict CO2 emissions based on the vehicle characteristic of engine size.

- **Code:** simple_co2_emission_predictor.py
- **Description:** Using scikit-learn's LinearRegression module, the script models and predicts CO2 emissions based on engine size using linear regression.
- **Training Data:** `FuelConsumptionCo2.csv`

## Multiple Linear Regression Projects

### 1. EcoPredict: Multi-Feature CO2 Emission Model

This project demonstrates how to implement multiple linear regression using scikit-learn to predict CO2 emissions based on vehicle characteristics, including engine size, cylinders, and fuel consumption.

- **Code:** multi_co2_emission_predictor.py
- **Description:** Using scikit-learn's LinearRegression module, the script models and predicts CO2 emissions based on engine size, cylinders, fuel consumption in the city, and fuel consumption on the highway using multiple linear regression.
- **Training Data:** `FuelConsumptionCo2.csv`
