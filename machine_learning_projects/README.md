## Machine Learning with Python

This repository contains various projects to practice and learn different machine learning algorithms using Python. The projects use TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-Learn, Snap ML, and other libraries to demonstrate the implementation of these algorithms.

### Supervised Learning

Supervised learning involves training a model on labeled data, meaning each input is paired with the correct output. The goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs.

- **Linear Regression:** Used for predicting a continuous variable.
- **Logistic Regression:** Used for binary classification tasks (predicting probabilities).
- **Decision Trees:** A tree-like structure where each internal node represents a feature, and each leaf represents an outcome.
    - **Regression Trees:** A type of decision tree used specifically for predicting continuous variables (a subset of decision trees).
- **Random Forest:** An ensemble of decision trees that improves prediction by averaging multiple models.
- **LightGBM:** A gradient boosting framework based on decision trees, designed for high performance in both classification and regression tasks.
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM):** Finds the hyperplane that maximizes the margin between different classes.
- **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN):** Classifies data points based on the majority class of their nearest neighbors.
- **Naive Bayes:** A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem, assuming independence between predictors.
- **Neural Networks:** Composed of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons), commonly used for tasks like image and speech recognition.

### Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning involves training a model on data that lacks labeled outcomes, with the goal of finding hidden patterns or structures.

- **k-Means Clustering:** A simple clustering algorithm that groups data into k clusters based on similarity.
- **Hierarchical Clustering:** Builds a hierarchy of clusters either by a divisive or agglomerative approach.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** A dimensionality reduction technique that transforms data to a lower-dimensional space.
- **Autoencoders:** A type of neural network used for unsupervised learning, often for dimensionality reduction and anomaly detection.
- **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM):** A probabilistic model for representing normally distributed subpopulations within an overall population.

### Semi-Supervised Learning

Semi-supervised learning uses a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data for training.

- **Self-training:** A model is trained on labeled data and then used to label the unlabeled data iteratively.
- **Co-training:** Two classifiers are trained on different feature sets, and they label the data for each other.

### Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning involves training an agent to take actions in an environment to maximize cumulative reward.

- **Q-Learning:** A value-based reinforcement learning algorithm that learns the value of an action in a particular state.
- **Deep Q-Networks (DQN):** Combines Q-Learning with deep neural networks to solve more complex problems.
Policy Gradient Methods: Directly optimize the policy that the agent uses to select actions.

### Ensemble Methods

Ensemble learning combines multiple models to improve performance.

- **Bagging (e.g., Random Forest):** Reduces variance by averaging predictions from multiple models trained on different data subsets.
- **Boosting (e.g., AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost):** Focuses on improving models by correcting errors of previous models iteratively.
