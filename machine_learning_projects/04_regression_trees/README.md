## Regression Trees

### 1. Boston Housing Price Predictor: Regression Trees

This project demonstrates the implementation of regression trees using Scikit-Learn to predict the median value of owner-occupied homes based on various features of areas in Boston.

- **Code:** housing_price_regression_tree.py
- **Description:** The script uses Scikit-Learn's DecisionTreeRegressor to model and predict the median housing prices in Boston. It preprocesses the data, trains regression tree models with different criteria (MSE and MAE), and evaluates their performance using RÂ² score and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). 
- **Training Data:** `real_estate_data.csv`

### 2. NYC Taxi Tip Predictor: Decision Tree Regression with Scikit-Learn & Snap ML

This project demonstrates the implementation of decision tree regression models using Scikit-Learn and Snap ML to predict the tip amount for NYC taxi trips.

- **Code:** taxi_tip_regression_tree.py
- **Description:** The script uses a real NYC taxi trip dataset to train regression models for predicting the tip amount. It explores data preprocessing, building regression models, and evaluating their performance. Two libraries are used: Scikit-Learn, a popular machine learning library, and Snap ML, an IBM library offering efficient CPU/GPU implementations and novel algorithms. Due to the large size of the yellow_tripdata_2019-06.csv dataset, it couldn't be uploaded to GitHub.
- **Training Data:** `yellow_tripdata_2019-06.csv`. Due to size constraints, the data is not included in the repository. However, the dataset can be downloaded from Kaggle using the following link:
