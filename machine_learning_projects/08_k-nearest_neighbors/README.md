## K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

### 1. Customer Group Classifier: KNN Model

This project demonstrates the implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm using scikit-learn for classification tasks in predicting customer group memberships based on demographic data.

- **Code:** customer_classifier_knn.py
- **Description:** The script reads in a dataset containing demographic data such as region, age, marital status, and other characteristics, then utilizes the KNN algorithm to build a classification model. This model predicts the customer group (custcat) to which new or unknown cases belong. The KNN classifier is trained on the dataset, and its accuracy is evaluated using a train-test split approach.
- **Training Data:** `teleCust1000t.csv`
