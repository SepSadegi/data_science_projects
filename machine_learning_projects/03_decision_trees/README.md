### 1. MedDecision Tree: Patient Medication Predictor

This project demonstrates how to implement decision trees using scikit-learn to predict the appropriate medication for patients based on their characteristics.

- **Code:** medication_decision_tree.py
- **Description:** The script reads a dataset containing patient information such as age, sex, blood pressure (BP), cholesterol levels, and sodium-to-potassium ratio. It uses a decision tree classifier to model and predict the drug each patient should be prescribed. The decision tree is trained on the dataset, and its accuracy is evaluated using a train-test split approach. Additionally, the decision tree is visualized to illustrate the decision-making process, and the visualization is saved to decision_tree.png.
- **Training Data:** `drug200.csv`
