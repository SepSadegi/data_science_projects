# Tips and Takeaway Notes

### Data Sampling Strategy

1. **Sampling Order:**
   - **First:** Sample the test dataset.
   - **Second:** Sample the validation dataset.
   - **Last:** Sample the training dataset.
   - **Why:** Ensures a representative test set and helps match the validation set to the test set distribution.

2. **Avoid Patient Overlap:**
   - **Issue:** Avoid having images from the same patient in both the training and test sets to prevent the model from learning patient-specific features.
   - **Tip:** Make sure the test set patients are not in the training set.


### Tips and Takeaway Notes for small Datasets

When working with a small training set (around 5,000 images), consider these straightforward tips:

1. **Don’t Retrain Everything:**
    - **Why:** Training all layers of a pre-trained model might lead to overfitting because your small dataset may not provide enough data to generalize well.
    - **Tip:** Freeze most of the model’s layers and only train a few of the later ones.

2. **Train Higher Layers:**
    - **Why:** The first layers of a model learn basic features like edges, which aren’t specific to your dataset.
    - **Tip:** Fine-tune the higher layers to make the model better at recognizing the unique patterns in your data.
 
 3. **Leverage Pre-Trained Models:**
    - **Why:** Pre-trained models already know how to detect common features, saving you time and effort. 
    - **Tip:** Use a pre-trained model, freeze the early layers, and adjust the last few layers to fit your specific dataset.
    
   
### Tips and Takeaway Notes for Large Datasets

When working with a very large dataset (around 1 million images), consider the following strategies:

1. **Full Model Training:**
    - **Why:** With a large dataset, you have enough data to train all layers of a pre-trained model without overfitting.
    - **Tip:** Fine-tune the entire pre-trained model to leverage its initial knowledge while adapting it to your dataset.

2. **Training Beyond the Last Layer:**
    - **Why:** A large dataset allows you to train more than just the last layer, improving performance and making the model more specific to your task.
    - **Tip:** Consider retraining several layers, particularly the higher ones, to better capture the unique features of your data.
 
 3. **Training a New Model:**
    - **Why:** With ample data, you have the option to train a model from scratch. This can sometimes yield better results than starting with a pre-trained model.
    - **Tip:** If computational resources allow, experiment with training a new model from randomly initialized weights to potentially achieve superior performance.
    
4. **Efficient Training:**
    - **Why:** Training from scratch can be time-consuming, but using a pre-trained model can speed up the process.
    - **Tip:** For faster results, start with a pre-trained model and then fine-tune it on your large dataset.
