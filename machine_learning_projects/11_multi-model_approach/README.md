## Multi-Model Approach

### 1. Credit Card Fraud Detection using Decision Tree and Support Vector Machine

This project demonstrates how to implement credit card fraud detection using Scikit-Learn and Snap ML. The models used include Decision Tree and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify transactions as legitimate or fraudulent.

- **Code:** credit_card_fraud_detection_with_scikit_snapml.py
- **Description:** Using Scikit-Learn and Snap ML libraries, the script preprocesses a dataset containing credit card transactions, then trains and evaluates Decision Tree and SVM models to detect fraudulent transactions. Snap ML provides high-performance implementations for these models, enhancing training speed and accuracy. 
- **Training Data:** `creditcard.csv`. Due to size constraints, the data is not included in the repository. However, the dataset can be downloaded from Kaggle using the following link:
