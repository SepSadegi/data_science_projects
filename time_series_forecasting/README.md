This repository is for practising time series analysis and forecasting. Time series are datasets where each data point is linked to a specific timestamp. Typically, these points are arranged in chronological order and recorded at regular intervals (e.g., every minute or every day).

The goal of time series forecasting is to learn patterns from past data to predict future values. A common example is predicting stock prices, but it also applies to things like forecasting seasonal clothing sales or weather patterns. Unlike standard regression problems, time series data is time-dependent and often exhibits trends or seasonality.
